Capturing the perfect cat photo can be challenging, but with these tips, you'll be taking Instagram-worthy shots in no time!

## Saturday relax time 

1. I wake up early this morning feeling not so tired ,so i did a bit of gardening ,get rid of the weed.
2. fixed the holes on the pajama and on the green velvet cusion covers with the sewing machine. moony came to ask me open the door for him couple of times , then it starts raining , he had too came back in , poor moony.
3. ketherine ask su  bring me one of the camera to check on boo and moony when i am in the hospital doing chemo, that is very thoughtful of both of them ,i have it set up in the bedroom because that is where boo and moony sleeps and also it is next to the powerpoint , close enough to the router. the set up was not easy ,due to it requires me to connect to the wifi at 2.4ghz instead of 5ghz, but i figured it out eventually.
4. then i felt like i need an reward ,so i brewed the tea and took out the leftover cupcakes from the fridge, they are from tania, the lovely lady from the office who also gave me the white flowers ; speaking of the flowers , they smell devine, what are their names ? i need to found out. i had the tea and cup cakes ,feeling relaxed.
5. got a photo from su showing jae is working on the retaining walls , looking very hard-core. i ll go there soon and i am thinking to bring them the afternoon tea.
6. just when i tried to take a nap before i leave , boo puked on the bed , and the carpet , and then the bed again. boo has her own way of keeping me buzy.
