We had dumplings for dinner, and then he taught me how to post on the website.
We're planning to go for a walk afterwards.

## What Should We Be Mindful of When Walking at Night?

1. Always carry a phone with sufficient battery
2. Stay in well-lit areas
3. Be aware of your surroundings
4. Let someone know where you're going
5. Wear comfortable shoes and bring a light jacket

散完步回家睡个好觉吧
