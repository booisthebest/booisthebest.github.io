Capturing the perfect cat photo can be challenging, but with these tips, you'll be taking Instagram-worthy shots in no time!

## Friday: Time to Relax and unwind

1. I woke up early this morning feeling not so tired, so I did a bit of gardening and got rid of the weeds.

2. Fixed the holes in the pajamas and the green velvet cushion covers with the sewing machine. Moony came to ask me to open the door for him a couple of times. Then it started raining, so he had to come back in - poor Moony!

3. Katherine asked Su to bring me one of the cameras to check on Boo and Moony when I'm in the hospital doing chemo. That was very thoughtful of both of them! I set it up in the bedroom because that's where Boo and Moony sleep, and it's also next to the power point, close enough to the router. The setup wasn't easy since it required me to connect to the WiFi at 2.4GHz instead of 5GHz, but I figured it out eventually.

4. Then I felt like I needed a reward, so I brewed some tea and took out the leftover cupcakes from the fridge. They were from Tania, the lovely lady from the office who also gave me the white flowers. Speaking of the flowers, they smell divine! What are their names? I need to find out. I had the tea and cupcakes, feeling relaxed.

5. Got a photo from Su showing Jae working on the retaining walls, looking very hardcore. I'll go there soon, and I'm thinking of bringing them afternoon tea.

6. Just when I tried to take a nap before leaving, Boo puked on the bed, and the carpet, and then the bed again. Boo has her own way of keeping me busy.
